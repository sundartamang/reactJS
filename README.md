### Defination
- useCallback is a React Hook that lets you cache a function definition between re-renders


### Defination
- skipping re-rendering of components 
- updating state from a memoized callback
- Preventing an effect from firing too often

### Troubleshooting
- Every time my component renders, useCallback returns a different function
